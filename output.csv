Kanye West,"Kanye West would be the first person to tell you he belongs on this list. The dude doesn’t believe in false modesty, and he shouldn’t. Kanye’s belief in himself and his incredible tenacity—he performed his first single with his jaw wired shut—got him to where he is today. And he fought for his place in the cultural pantheon with a purpose. In his debut album, over a decade ago, Kanye issued what amounted to a social critique and a call to arms (with a beat): “We rappers is role models: we rap, we don’t think.” But Kanye does think. Constantly. About everything. And he wants everybody else to do the same: to engage, question, push boundaries. Now that he’s a pop-culture juggernaut, he has the platform to achieve just that. He’s not afraid of being judged or ridiculed in the process. Kanye’s been playing the long game all along, and we’re only just beginning to see why.Musk, an engineer and entrepreneur, is the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla MotorsPick up the TIME 100 issue on newsstands, or click here to buy it online.",http://time.com/3822841/kanye-west-2015-time-100/,None
Lorne Michaels,"When I called Lorne Michaels to talk about writing this piece, he mentioned that he’d been in the TIME 100 once before, in 2008. And I wondered, Who could TIME have chosen in between as having more influence in comedy?I’ve had the pleasure of trailing Lorne during an episode of Saturday Night Live, editing as he goes, writing as he goes, directing as he goes. Hard to think of anyone more skilled at discovering extraordinary comedic performers, who have gone on to become household names in their own right. It’s no wonder SNL‘s takes on current events have made headlines for 40 years.But as Lorne’s friend, I know that he is graciously suspect of admiration, and he understands that a discussion or dissection of humor is doomed to be dull. His credo: be funny and get on with it. (Note to TIME: if this is too short, please remember that brevity is the soul of wit. If this is too long, ask Lorne for help—he’s good at editing.)Nicholson is a three-time Oscar-winning actor",http://time.com/3822845/lorne-michaels-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/lorne-michaels-time-100-2015-titans.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Mellody Hobson,"I met Mellody Hobson when she was a senior in high school at a breakfast for Chicago business elite. Quite frankly, I don’t remember any of the Chicago business elite, but I did remember Mellody because she made such a deep impression.Mellody is determined, disciplined and enormously curious. I’ve seen her abilities manifested in the boardroom at Starbucks, where we both serve. She’s always very direct. You do not have to wonder what Mellody’s opinion is. She also has a deep commitment to improving financial literacy among moderate and low-income Americans.From her efforts as president of Ariel Investments to her work in my presidential campaign, Mellody exudes a cheerful confidence that makes people want to follow her. She has said her goals are to do well, surrounded by interesting people, and change the world for the better. Since she’s already doing those things now, just imagine what the next 30 years will bring.Bradley is a former three-term Senator from New Jersey",http://time.com/3822587/mellody-hobson-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/mellody-hobson-time-100-2015-titans.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Tim Cook,"It could not have been easy for Tim Cook to step into the immense shadow cast by the late Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs. But with grace and courage and an unabashed willingness to be his own man, Tim has pushed Apple to unimaginable profitability—and greater social responsibility. He is setting a new standard for what business can do in the world. Tim is unwavering in his support of an individual’s right to privacy and is not only embracing equality and LGBT rights but advocating for change through his words and actions. His commitment to renewable energy is also leaving our planet a little cleaner and a little greener for generations yet unborn.Above all, he has shown that profitability and integrity can go hand in hand. Tim has done this while introducing, time and again, some of the most innovative products the world has ever seen. Tim Cook is proof that even the most successful companies can and should be judged by more than just their bottom line.Lewis is a civil rights leader and Democratic Congressman from Georgia",http://time.com/3822599/tim-cook-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/time-cook-time-100-2015-icons.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Elizabeth Holmes,"Elizabeth Holmes’ is a story that could happen only in America. After her sophomore year she left Stanford to devote herself to a vision of health care available as a basic human right. When I was introduced to Elizabeth by George Shultz, her plan sounded like an undergraduate’s dream. I told her she had only two prospects: total failure or vast success. There would be no middle ground.Elizabeth accepted only one option: making a difference. Striking, somewhat ethereal, iron-willed, she is on the verge of achieving her vision—through a new method of blood testing that significantly reduces costs, tests for a whole range of infections and is mobile and can therefore be easily transported to underdeveloped regions.Striving for prevention and early detection, she is dedicated to transforming health care around the world. She manages an expanding global business by the refusal to be daunted by any obstacle.Elizabeth is in the process of turning an undergraduate’s vision into a global reality. That she combines fierce and single-minded dedication with great charm makes her a formidable advocate.

Charles Koch & David Koch,"Charles and David Koch are well known for their business success, their generous philanthropic efforts and for their focus on innovation in management. Some also know them for their activism in the political realm. All of these are important contributions to society. What is underappreciated is their passion for freedom and their commitment to ideas. Unlike many crony capitalists who troll the halls of Congress looking for favors, the Kochs have consistently lobbied against special-interest politics.For decades they have funded institutes that promote ideas, not politics, such as Cato and the Mercatus Center. They have always stood for freedom, equality and opportunity. Consistent with their love of liberty, they have become prominent advocates for criminal-justice reform. The Koch brothers’ investment in freedom-loving think tanks will carry on for generations, reminding all of us that ideas and convictions ultimately trump all else.Paul is a U.S. Senator and a 2016 presidential candidate",http://time.com/3822767/charles-koch-david-koch-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/charles-koch-david-koch-brothers-time-100-2015-titans.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Susan Wojcicki,"Susan Wojcicki is a truly charmed soul. She has this innate navigational system that enables her to operate on a higher plane. She is, in fact, connected to “the source”—that place where the supergifted achieve a state of flow.When Google was created in her garage, it marked a pivotal moment in the history of the world. This ignited Susan’s epic journey, which today finds her at the helm of yet another transformational platform: YouTube.Like me, Susan believes in the power of story and knows that everything and everyone has its own narrative that deserves to be told. YouTube aggregates all of those stories, in all shapes and sizes, and makes them available to the world. It sounds simple, but the power of YouTube has made it the most valuable storytelling outlet our planet has ever seen.Of course there are many other platforms, including the ones I primarily use in the form of theatrical releases and network and cable television, but the world goes to YouTube. We go there to find those beautiful, creative experiments, and through them we discover new talent in all forms. Never before has this been possible at this scale.It only makes sense that someone as transcendent as Susan would be the visionary behind YouTube’s next evolution. Under her leadership, YouTube is becoming an even more ubiquitous experience, where the most inexpensive, rudimentary stories can be told right alongside those with unlimited resources.

Chanda Kochhar,"You can’t miss Chanda Kochhar as she walks through the Congress Centre at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, or into a meeting of the board of directors of the Institute of International Finance, always resplendent in an elegant sari.Her calm, soft-spoken and understated demeanor belies her strength of conviction and clarity of thought.When Chanda speaks, people listen carefully.She has shaped retail banking in India ever since she assumed her pivotal role in establishing ICICI Bank during the 1990s. As managing director and CEO since 2009, she has brought India’s largest private bank a global vision and impressive returns, while also reaching out to the nation’s masses with branches in remote villages where banks simply didn’t exist.When young women turn to her for advice, she tells them to put aside their unconscious inhibitions, saying, “Don’t give up on something just because you think you can’t do it.”I have yet to find anything Chanda can’t do.

Tony Fernandes,"More than 8 million people are in the air each day traveling in planes, trusting their lives to the care of strangers. Technicians, in-flight crew, pilots. You don’t hear much when things go as planned. When things go wrong, there is terrible speculation, uncertainty and questions from every direction.People reveal their true selves in the worst of times. After learning that AirAsia Flight 8501 had gone missing, Tony Fernandes stilled the chaos by being himself—a family man and a business leader. He guided his company and employees through the horror. As AirAsia continued to serve its passengers, Tony acted as a friend, father and son to families whose darkest days were not done.The end of every journey is home.

Lee Daniels,"Nothing quite prepared me for working with Lee Daniels. Two years ago, I stepped onto the set of The Butler for my first appearance in a movie in 15 years. Lee was directing my first scene when he suddenly came from behind the camera, rushed over to me and shouted, “Stop acting!”That’s the reason actors love working with Lee. He forces you, in every breath, to stay in character. To find the bone-marrow truth in every scene, no matter what it takes to get there. He’s a truth seeker. “Less is more” is his credo. “Give me 1/8 of that” is one of my favorite notes from him.And now with the runaway success of Fox’s Empire, his seductive new hip-hop drama, it seems like there is nothing Lee can’t do. He is taking us all on an uninhibited, bodacious ride, bringing in new viewers each week at a pace that is unheard of in today’s television landscape.His eyes and ears are attuned to nuance.

Reid Hoffman,"Back in 2004, when Mark Zuckerberg and I were starting Facebook, Reid Hoffman was the first person we called to fund the company. There has always been something different about Reid, owing to his gregarious good nature, honest advice and keen intellect. He set us up with Peter Thiel and suggested that Peter join the Facebook board; Reid was too busy launching LinkedIn, but he agreed to give us our first funding anyway.Reid has tirelessly worked to channel the capabilities of social media toward a more productive purpose. LinkedIn succeeded in connecting the professional world, enabling social mobility on an unprecedented scale. The result was a revolution; the world was suddenly a much smaller, much more connected and ultimately much more productive place.

Kim Kardashian West,"Kim Kardashian West is a media phenomenon. She has 29 million followers on Instagram and 31 million followers on Twitter, and her E! show, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, is considered appointment TV by a large and diverse audience.Why? Why? Why? we might ask ourselves. Here are some very good reasons.Beautiful in an exotic, totally exaggerated way, Kim exudes energy, sexuality, drama, determination, impetuousness and happiness. But she and her famous, entrepreneurial siblings—shepherded by a savvy, tireless matriarch—have also expanded the very definition of family.The Kardashians are a totally modern construct. They are a blended family, of Armenian descent, with biracial pairings (Kim is married to Kanye West) and a reportedly transgender parent. They work hard, and they stick together through thick and thin.Despite the flamboyance, the self-aggrandizement and the self-promotion (Kim set out to break the Internet by baring her bum in an extraordinary photograph), Kim comes across as an enviable big sister in a clan where everyone seems to love one another. Are they indeed today’s Brady Bunch?Where does Kim go from here?

In Washington, where political wrangling often leads to paralysis, her Federal Reserve can actually decide and act.Janet is special, being the first woman to occupy her job. She is a trailblazer. I cheer for Janet when watching her in action, and it’s a privilege to discuss research and policy with her.Janet is smart, experienced and deliberate.

Danny Meyer,"On a late summer day in 1992, Danny Meyer and I sat down in Union Square Park to talk about a new kind of restaurant—one that married the warmest form of great service with soulful, indelible food. The result was Gramercy Tavern, a restaurant that ushered in a new era of American dining. But that day in the park we didn’t talk about menus or decor. We talked about how to make people on both sides of the table feel valued and cared for. How putting employees first would translate to a memorable experience for our guests.As Danny’s business has grown, from a single restaurant to a nearly $2 billion Shake Shack burger empire with outlets around the world, its core has never changed.

Lei Jun,"He wears casual shirts and jeans. He sells smartphones, presiding over glitzy, stage-managed unveilings of his new products. It’s no wonder that Lei Jun, the founder of the Chinese cell-phone maker Xiaomi, is often compared to Steve Jobs. Yet even the late Apple visionary couldn’t boast of expanding so swiftly within just five years of the company’s founding.During a single 12-hour period in April, Xiaomi sold 2.1 million phones online, boosting profits by eliminating middleman vendors. Critics contend that Lei’s low-cost handsets borrow too heavily from Apple. They may have a point—Xiaomi’s offerings include a Mi Note phone and a Mi Pad tablet. But investors aren’t worried. After another round of financing late last year, Xiaomi was valued at some $46 billion, earning Lei’s company the title of the world’s most valuable tech startup. It’s paid off for Lei, a multibillionaire who has become one of the richest people in China.

Bob Iger,"Inheriting a legendary brand is both a burden and blessing. Bob Iger could have been haunted by the past, but he has instead created a powerhouse for the company’s future, diversifying the portfolio and yet not traducing the tradition.Hollywood is full of what are loosely called “characters,” a term that is sometimes merely a lousy excuse for bad behavior. But Bob is a thoughtful leader and an earnest individual, decent and dignified, farsighted and focused.The common theme running throughout the Disney businesses is family—whether it’s movies, television shows, theme parks, Broadway shows or cruises. They are beautifully and successfully integrated businesses. And there is no doubt ESPN is a juggernaut.Hollywood blinked when Bob spent $15 billion on Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel. But they turned out to be great and logical investments that have kept Disney on the front foot.

Satya Nadella,"Satya Nadella is setting Microsoft up for greatness again. For decades, Microsoft had controlled the software world, but its grip slipped with the rise of mobile and cloud technologies. Though a longtime employee, Satya brought a fresh and almost revolutionary perspective to the CEO job, breaking with the past by building for new platforms first. In his short but impactful tenure, he has focused on driving openness where Microsoft was once closed, even when it has meant supporting competing services in the process. Changes that once would have been considered blasphemous—releasing open-source software, building on iOS and Android and even making Windows free in some cases—are turning Microsoft around. Satya is basically the star of one of those teen movies where the parents go out of town and the kid takes control of the place.

Jorge Paulo Lemann,"I’d put Jorge Lemann in the top four or five smartest people I know on Wall Street. A few years back, his investment fund 3G Capital—the dealmakers behind the $28 billion buyout of Heinz in 2013—put a fair bit in our fund. Lemann and one of his associates, Alex Behring, had come over to my office to talk. It turns out Lemann spends some time in New York, and I said, “We should get together out in the Hamptons, hit a few balls.” I used to be a club tennis player, and I figured, I can give him a pretty good game. “We’ll bet on it!” I said. He’s a quiet guy, and he just smiled and said, “Perhaps.” And then Alex touched me on the arm and said, “I don’t think you want to do that.” “How come?” I asked. He said, “Well, he used to be one of the top players in the world.” So I quickly said, “Forget the betting!” Like I said, he’s a smart guy.Icahn is the majority shareholder in Icahn Enterprises",http://time.com/3822760/jorge-paulo-lemann-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/jorge-paulo-lemann-time-100-2015-titans-illustration.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Misty Copeland,"Like all gymnasts, I’ve done some ballet—it’s a part of our program. And people don’t realize the tremendous amount of time and work you have to put in to do the maneuvers they do. Ballerinas like Misty Copeland look so beautiful and perfect, but it takes thousands of hours of hard work to make it look that easy.It was an honor to learn that a movie about me inspired a 7-year-old Misty to see the joy in movement. When I competed in the 1976 Olympics, no one thought that a 14-year-old from a place people couldn’t find on a map could contend. Misty proves that success is not about how you grow up or the color of your skin. Her story—of overcoming personal and physical challenges to become a soloist at the American Ballet Theatre—is the story of someone who followed her dreams and refused to give up. In that way, she is a model for all young girls.It doesn’t matter where you’re from.

Scott Kelly,"Scott Kelly’s yearlong mission aboard the International Space Station is indeed worthy of special note and attention. We need to know much more about human reaction to long-term spaceflight before any deeper exploratory missions can be planned. But what may be of greater significance to all of us here on Earth is research into the remarkable similarities between how the body changes in zero-G and how it changes as a result of ordinary aging. If we learn more about one, we could apply that same knowledge toward arresting both. We started this type of research when I returned to space in 1998, and I am very glad it is being continued with this mission.

Emmanuelle Charpentier & Jennifer Doudna,"No one, not even a bacterium, likes being infected by a virus, and early in evolution, bacteria developed a way to destroy viruses with exquisitely precise attacks. Very recently, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna figured out the inner workings of this bacterial self-protection, and then, in a tour de force of elegant deduction and experiment, they developed a plug-and-play version of that approach. Their technique, CRISPR-Cas9, gives scientists the power to remove or add genetic material at will. Working with cells in a lab, geneticists have used this technology to cut out HIV, to correct sickle-cell anemia and to alter cancer cells to make them more susceptible to chemotherapy. With CRISPR-Cas9, a scientist could, in theory, alter any human gene.

He dares to believe that we shouldn’t be strangers, that we can have a sense of true belonging whenever, wherever we travel.With his remarkable startup, Airbnb, he saw a new way to build community through people’s innate desire to connect with the world around them. The service that Brian and his partners imagined is soaringly ambitious and utterly practical.As a designer (he graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design), his obsession with detail and practicality doesn’t confine or compromise his dreaming but rather makes what could so easily be noble but abstract ideas functional and real.Staying in someone else’s home is an intimate experience. It requires trust. Brian collaborates with designers, artists, architects, illustrators and engineers to take guests and hosts on a gentle but exhilarating journey, enabled by a site that is as beautiful as it is functional.Bringing people together is something of a passion for Brian, and with Airbnb he’s helped create millions of personal connections.

Jimmy Lai,"There are those who, when given the keys to wealth and the perks of the Establishment, choose not to rock the boat because of the backlash they might face. Jimmy Lai is not such a person.Though he went from a child laborer in a garment factory to owning his own clothing line and media company, he rejected complacency and the status quo when he chose to criticize a powerful government and support a primarily student-led democracy movement in his beloved Hong Kong.His courage in the face of the firebombing of his home, as well as his subsequent arrest for his role in challenging the ruling order, resonates around the world as an inspiration for those seeking self-determination.

Emma Watson,"Emma Watson’s alter ego Hermione Granger would doubtless approve of her HeForShe campaign and its gutsy, smart take on feminism.It’s especially refreshing to see men invited to join the fight for gender equality, as Watson pointedly did in launching the U.N. effort last fall, telling the men that it’s “your issue too.”It’s also refreshing to see her vigorous embrace of feminism, which Watson defines as “the theory of political, economic and social equality of the sexes.” And apparently she lives by it. Although she is one of the world’s highest-paid actresses, she has spoken out about the paucity of female directors in Hollywood.Watson was only 9 when she auditioned for the part of Hermione, and she appeared in every Harry Potter film to the end. She followed Hogwarts with a degree in English literature from Brown University.Her HeForShe speech at Davos was an Internet sensation, but unsurprisingly, it drew the typical antifeminist rants and even some threats. Watson chose to highlight the moving letters she has received from fathers who tell her they are investing new hope in the future for their daughters. But she was also frank about the bullying tactics of her detractors and one site that made an empty threat to release nude photos.

Vikram Patel,"It is hard to imagine a more difficult challenge than addressing the unmet needs of those from resource-poor countries who live with and suffer from mental-health disorders. And yet Vikram Patel has spent his career doing just that. Some champions of the underserved have a handful of talents on which they rely to maintain their momentum and sustain their efforts. Fortunately for those who are the most vulnerable and the most misunderstood, Patel has many. He is a gifted psychiatrist, a dedicated researcher, a successful author of books and academic papers, and he is an effective communicator. In fact, he seems to have an unending supply of these critical skills.

Pardis Sabeti,"When the Ebola epidemic began in West Africa, Dr. Pardis Sabeti led a team that did something critically important: it sequenced virus samples from infected patients almost as soon as the outbreak began. This marked the first in-depth use of real-time DNA sequencing in the midst of such a deadly pandemic. Pardis and her team were able to work out clearly that the virus was spreading human to human—not from mosquito bites or some pig vector or something else. There were so many theories out there, but her work proves that there’s nothing like real data to get rid of myths and guesses and get down to the facts. Many of her scientific collaborators died during this outbreak. This is high-risk research, but it ended up saving a lot of lives too.

Reese Witherspoon,"Reese Witherspoon’s portrayal of Cheryl Strayed in Wild was my favorite performance of any actor in any movie last year, or any year, for as long as I can remember. It was especially powerful because it was so risky. Virtually every character Reese has played could be described as “plucky” and “likable,” but here was a troubled and heartbroken woman doing things we so rarely get to see women do onscreen, and she was still plucky and likable.But the reason Reese is on this list is that she is no longer just a talented and famous actress. She is an icon. Yes, she is beautiful, and I would buy any lipstick or bottled water she is selling. Hell, I’d buy cigarettes if her picture were on the pack. But that’s not it (even though I think she could make a lot of money doing that). Reese is an artist, but she is also a hustler, a quality I recognized in her the first time I met her. She’s impatient that Hollywood won’t generate the kind of quality roles she wants to play, so she creates quality roles by creating quality movies. That resourcefulness is what makes her someone I not only admire, but someone who inspires me. And that is influence.Kaling is the creator and star of The Mindy Project",http://time.com/3822959/reese-witherspoon-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/reese-witherspoon-time-100-2015-pioneers.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Bryan Stevenson,"When I first heard Bryan Stevenson speak, I found myself admiring the way his gentle voice pulls you in to listen that much closer to the power behind his every word. But I imagine his mild manner is as much about delivering a clear message as it is his own way of conserving energy—for no one knows the steady pace that must be maintained on the long road to equality more than Bryan. For decades, he has dedicated himself to fighting poverty and challenging racial discrimination in the criminal-­justice system with the perfect combination of unwavering passion and idealism.Through the Equal Justice Initiative, which he founded in 1989, Bryan has combatted excessive and unfair sentencing, exonerated innocent prisoners on death row, challenged the abuse of the incarcerated and mentally ill, aided children prosecuted as adults and litigated on behalf of the poor as well as those whose race denied them a fair trial. This year, his organization’s report on lynchings of African Americans in the Jim Crow South documented at least 700 previously unknown victims.It is Bryan’s belief that every person is more than the worst thing they’ve ever done, which is a lesson to so many that forgiveness is a necessary means to achieving equality for all.Williams is the No. 1 women’s tennis player in the world",http://time.com/3823265/bryan-stevenson-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/bryan-stevenson-time-100-2015-pioneers.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Chai Jing,"Chai Jing’s 2015 documentary on pollution, Under the Dome, is one of the most important pieces of environmental awareness building ever in China. Her very personal and powerful story is one that millions of people in China can relate to, which points to the reason it was viewed 200 million times just days after it was first broadcast. Her background as an investigative reporter shines through as she weaves together complex scientific and policy issues into a coherent and compelling narrative that has empowered ordinary Chinese to join a policy debate for the first time. In fact, the documentary has made even those who are cynical and indifferent express their desire to join the fight against pollution. Such vast public support, if properly harnessed, could play a profound role in China’s crucial but challenging drive toward sustainability over the next 20 years.Ma is a Chinese environmentalist and journalist",http://time.com/3823269/chai-jing-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/jing-chai-time-100-2015-pioneers.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100

Aura Elena Farfán,"I visited Guatemala recently to do some work with forensic investigators and while there met with people whose family members had been buried in a recently exhumed mass grave. Supporting the families, as she so often is, was Aura Elena Farfán. Since the Guatemalan military abducted her brother in 1984, Aura Elena has been fighting for justice for the relatives of the tens of thousands who were disappeared or killed during the civil war. She is the founder of FAMDEGUA, an NGO that assists families in their search. Aura Elena has shown remarkable courage—and she gets results.

Martin Blaser,"As a scientist and author, Dr. Martin Blaser is an incredibly important voice on the consequences of our rampant overuse of antibiotics. Right now, 80% of antibiotics sold in the U.S. are used on mostly healthy animals on factory farms. Over time, this has caused routine bacteria to mutate into untreatable superbugs, putting human lives at risk. Some food companies have responded to public pressure and taken action, but too many in Washington refuse to lift a finger to protect antibiotics, instead bowing to industries that profit from maintaining the status quo. This is why we need people outside the government structure to move the conversation forward. Blaser’s work is a stunning dose of reality in an environment flooded with corporate-agenda-fulfilling pseudoscience.

Anita Sarkeesian,"Anita Sarkeesian has played video games her whole life. In 2012, after observing that women represent about 40% of the gaming audience, she launched a crowdfunding campaign for Tropes vs. Women in Video Games, a web series that would “explore five common and recurring stereotypes of female characters in video games.” She hit her goal of $6,000 on the first day and ultimately raised more than $150,000. But she also became the target of vicious, misogynist harassment that included death and rape threats, pornographic vandalism of her Wikipedia page and a coordinated effort to have her Kickstarter flagged as terrorism. All of this because she wanted to have a conversation about the way women are portrayed in video games.Anita is just the latest woman writer to prove the law coined by journalist Helen Lewis: that the sexist comments on any article about feminism justify feminism. In the face of hysterical and childish abuse, Anita has refused to back down. She continues to speak around the world about the role of women in video games and popular media. She also talks about her life as a target in the online culture war known as Gamergate, waged by entitled male gamers who fear change in an industry that is evolving while they seem determined to remain 15 forever.Anita is a feminist for the digital age, using modern tools and platforms to engage thousands of people who want to hear her thoughts and respond to the challenges she raises. A lesser person may throw up her hands and unplug her game console, but Anita is determined to ensure that video games are inclusive and representative of everyone who plays them. As her detractors grow increasingly unhinged, we have proof that her efforts are working.Wheaton is an actor and the author of Just a Geek",http://time.com/3822727/anita-sarkeesian-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/anita-sarkeesian-time-100-2015-pioneers.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Tom Catena,"Meeting Tom Catena is the closest I have come to meeting a saint. He runs the Mother of Mercy Hospital in the war-torn Nuba Mountains of Sudan with an unparalleled level of devotion to his Catholic faith and the Nuban people who seek his care. Much of the region falls under rebel control. Civilians struggle to survive amid ground fighting, aerial bombardment and starvation warfare at the hands of their government. Humanitarian organizations are prohibited from delivering aid. Catena defies the ban and is the only surgeon serving a population of 750,000 people. He works tirelessly, day and night, treating all ailments, war injuries and starvation. He tells me his greatest reward is the sense of peace that comes from serving people in need, rebels and civilians alike.

Rudolph Tanzi,"I’m a child of Alzheimer’s, and I know firsthand how scary it is to watch the mind of someone you love get slowly erased. I also know that despite the fact that we’re in the middle of an epidemic, we simply don’t yet have the drive—or the drugs—to put an end to Alzheimer’s. But that doesn’t mean there’s no hope. Tanzi stands out as one of the few scientists who has committed his career to finding a cure for Alzheimer’s, and last year he brought us one step closer. In a truly remarkable feat, Tanzi created what’s been nicknamed “Alzheimer’s in a dish”—human brain cells that, in a petri dish, develop the markers of this terrible disease. This makes it possible for scientists to better study which of the countless drugs out there might actually slow or wipe out this mind-blowing disease.Shriver is an author, the executive producer of Still Alice and The Alzheimer’s Project and the founder of the Wipe Out Alzheimer’s Challenge",http://time.com/3823236/rudolph-tanzi-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/rudolph-tanzi-time-100-2015-pioneers-illustration.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Mustafa Hassan,"The word hero is overused and misused. The story of Mustafa Hassan, an aid worker from Sudan, and his work as a child-protection manager at the International Rescue Committee shows where it should be used. From Darfur to Syria, Mustafa’s life’s work is focused on protecting young and innocent children caught up in the barbarity of war.Thousands of Syrian children have arrived at the Za‘atari and Azraq refugee camps alone, separated from their families, not knowing whether their parents are alive or dead. Then they meet Mustafa. With a team of 50 he does the meticulous detective work needed to reunite children with their families or connect them with foster families. Working tirelessly, below the radar, in some of the toughest conditions in the world, Mustafa and people like him restore our faith in humanity.

Sarah Koenig,"How often is it that you rush home with the shopping or from work, make yourself a cup of tea and switch the phones off, then dim the lights so that you can be totally uninterrupted for 40 or 50 minutes to listen to a radio program? For weeks on end this past fall that’s what I and millions of others did every Thursday. I am of course referring to the podcast Serial. To say it was addictive is an understatement.Sarah Koenig talked to me in the bath, in the kitchen and in the subway, and although I knew there were plenty of others ­listening—the series has been downloaded more than 80 million times—she had an uncanny knack for making me feel like she was talking just to me. She and her team explored in incredible detail the real-life murder case of Hae Min Lee, who was last seen on Jan. 13, 1999. We shared in Koenig’s doubts and discoveries, thoughts and confusion; we became entangled in the mystery by listening to recordings of her phone calls with the imprisoned Adnan Syed, who, rightly or wrongly, was convicted of killing Hae.Koenig played us recordings from the courtroom and police interviews with suspects and witnesses. She searched out key players in the story and inquired about their recollections of a single day from 15 years ago. Suddenly, investigative journalism became our hobby, our passion. People were talking about it everywhere you went. It was a true cultural phenomenon, and radio was once again front and center in our daily lives.

Bradley Cooper,"I met Bradley Cooper in 2007, shooting an arc on the FX drama Nip/Tuck. Our characters had this wonderfully twisted relationship: I was a closeted TV producer in mad, unrequited love with Bradley, the ambitious, manipulative star of my soap opera. During our first take, he grabbed me by the lapels, threw me against a wall and launched into this insane in-character, off-script rant about how my not going to the gym was breaking his disgusted heart.Apparently, in our line of work, this is how great friendships begin. Turns out this psycho was in fact a loving, grounded, hardworking fellow whose priorities in life are his dog Charlotte, the Philadelphia Eagles and showing up for people he cares about.And yes, he’s a dazzling actor. Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle, The Elephant Man—these are increasingly brave, eccentric, breathtakingly diverse performances. I barely recognized him in American Sniper; physically and emotionally, he actually kind of disappeared.It’s hard to make people, especially your friends, forget who you are onscreen.

Richard Linklater,"Before becoming one of the foremost film directors of our generation, Richard Linklater worked nights as the bellman/valet at a fancy business hotel in Austin. One evening he picked up a young VIP from the airport. From the back of the hotel van, the man asked Rick how he liked his job.“This is the best job I’ve ever had,” he said. “I sit on my ass and get to read and write all night—basically what I’d be doing at home for free. I swear I’m nearly done with all of Tolstoy. Plus, I get to eat as much as I can find, and I usually take some home with me.”“Interesting,” the man said. Then Rick asked him, “And how do you like your job?”“Not so much,” the man answered. “You see, I’ve been hired by the national office to find more ways to be efficient at the Austin location and, well … you’re fired.”We may never understand Rick’s unorthodox path and how it led to movies like School of Rock, Before Sunrise and Boyhood: the vegetarian baseball star from Huntsville, Texas; the years of hard labor on offshore oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico; teaching himself the history of film through the ingenuity of starting the Austin Film Society (with the help of a local Kinko’s and a 16-mm projector). But the consistent thread in Rick’s career has been a passion for cinema that cannot be defeated or undermined in any way.Hawke is an American actor, screenwriter and novelist",http://time.com/3822985/richard-linklater-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/richard-linklater-time-100-2015-artists.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Chris Ofili,"Chris Ofili’s extraordinary talent is to speak about contemporary issues through the romance of painting. He achieved early success in London—winning the Turner Prize and representing Britain at the Venice Biennale—almost as soon as he emerged. With works like No Woman, No Cry and The Holy Virgin Mary, both breathtaking and controversial in equal measure, he positioned himself as an artist who could redefine art practice by affirming the relevance of painting for the 21st century. Since moving to Trinidad, he has drawn inspiration from the island, its natural beauty and its distinct cultural tropes. Incredibly, he has re-emerged with an equally powerful relevance. In his work, he seeks to speak to political issues; his is a social imperative. He asks questions about our time through intoxicating visual compositions that examine peripheral modernities and enable us to make sense of our world.Adjaye is an award-winning Ghanaian-British architect",http://time.com/3822991/chris-ofili-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/chris-ofili-time-100-2015-artists.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Julianna Margulies,"When I met Julianna Margulies last year, it didn’t take long to recognize a kindred spirit. It wasn’t just that we quickly began finishing each other’s sentences. It was her passion, fearlessness, empathy and an unwavering determination to make a difference in people’s lives off the screen that resonated with me.We began talking about Erin’s Law, a bill she has been fighting to get passed that’s named after Erin Merryn, who was sexually abused as a child for years but never told anyone because she was ashamed. Julianna said, “Erin’s Law has passed in 19 states, and Erin will not stop until all 50 have it. Until we give every kid a voice.”But you could tell Julianna isn’t going to stop either. She puts her heart and soul into every issue she cares about. She’s not afraid to dream big and do what she loves, whether it’s in her acting career, in her advocacy or being a mom.

Alexander Wang,"Alexander Wang and I met when we were both just beginning our careers—I was 15, and he was 24. The thing I remember most about that first meeting was that he was just so cool. He was a completely original mashup of youthful energy, street culture and high fashion. When I walked my first show for him, it was the coolest I’d ever felt or could ever hope to be. But that’s the secret to his designs.What I’ve seen him do in the past eight years is nothing short of remarkable. He is everywhere. His fashion shows are now some of the most hotly anticipated of Fashion Week. His name pops up in rap lyrics. He’s taken over as creative director at Balenciaga. Last year, he did a collection with H&M that flew off the shelves.The trick to his success isn’t just raw talent and a dedicated work ethic but his unique ability to make high fashion ubiquitous. The core of his empire is built on the fact that he loves his work and relishes his industry.It’s a testament to Alex’s skill and personality that at such a young age, he’s captured the attention of veterans in the industry. Everyone loves being around Alex—he’s full of life and a loving friend. Even after an exhausting full season, his spirit is irrepressible. He’s one of the most fun and fabulous people I’ve had the pleasure of working with and knowing.

Jill Soloway,"Years ago, I read a short story by Jill Soloway about the personal assistant of a successful Hollywood TV actress who is tasked with addressing tabloid rumors that her boss bleaches her anus. Oh, and she—the assistant, not the actress—is unable to achieve orgasm. She also attends a 12-step group for celebrity assistants to deal with her “shanger,” that uncomfortable place between shame and anger. It’s a really short short story, barely a handful of pages, and yet within those Jill managed to convey the very real pain of a soul yearning to be authentic in a completely inauthentic world, as well as that soul’s eventual success in achieving desired authenticity. It was absurd, sad, uncomfortable, hilarious, angry, compassionate and brilliant. It was my first encounter with Jill’s singular, audacious voice, which continues to speak loudly for all who yearn for an authentic life—and we are all the better for it.Ball is the Emmy-winning creator of True Blood and Six Feet Under",http://time.com/3822910/jill-soloway-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/jill-soloway-time-100-2015-artists.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Chris Pratt,"Chris Pratt is here to save us—from aliens, dinosaurs and general boredom. America has decided he is its next big movie star, and I understand why. It’s not because of his broad shoulders and humble roots. It’s not because he looks like the perfect combination of a guy you know mixed with a guy you want to be. It’s because he has that something special. That magic thing that lets you know he is used to working hard and isn’t interested in wasting your time. He’s a facile and generous actor who is very smart but never concerned about proving that to you. He doesn’t forget that this whole thing is supposed to be fun, which I had the pleasure of seeing firsthand on Parks and Recreation. He is a real man in a sea of ciphers, a good father and friend, and one naturally funny dude.

Audra McDonald,"Beautiful. Intelligent. Extraordinarily talented. These are just a few words that describe the incomparable Audra McDonald. She has acted on television and in movies, graced theater and concert stages and given a gift to countless fans with a voice that I can only describe as being blessed by God.Audra has accomplished incredible things in her career. She’s won more Tony awards than any other Broadway performer, most recently for playing Billie Holiday in Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar and Grill. But I feel the greatest legacy she will leave behind lies in the works she does for others.Never afraid to stand up for what she believes, Audra is a strong voice speaking out for humane treatment of animals, dignity for the homeless and marriage equality.I had the pleasure of getting to know Audra during our time on NBC’s telecast of The Sound of Music Live! and I can honestly say that simply being in her presence was a gift. She is mesmerizing. I would often find myself messing up lines or songs because I was in awe of everything she was doing as the Mother Abbess.I knew from the moment I heard her angelic voice that I was in the presence of greatness, and my thoughts about her were only intensified when I saw a glimpse of her amazing heart.

Tim McGraw,"“Art reflects life,” Tim McGraw says, alluding to an idea that goes back to Plato and Aristotle, “and life reflects art.” When he first went to Nashville more than two decades ago, he was, as he puts it, “young, single and tearing it up,” and his early songs reflected his life’s manic pace. Now married to the luminous Faith Hill, with whom he has three daughters, McGraw is making music that’s more about raising a family than raising hell—more about seeking lasting connection and celebrating continuity. His song “Shotgun Rider” is an ode to enduring love: “I don’t ever want to wake up/ Lookin’ into someone else’s eyes.” After a brilliant performance at the Oscars in February, he’s got a movie (Tomorrowland, with George Clooney) coming out in May and a 36-city tour beginning in June. He moves between genres with the same down-to-earth grace that’s always on display at the Nashville high school football games he never misses. A big reader of serious novels and of history, McGraw’s a kind of Renaissance man in a cowboy hat, and it’s clear he’s got a lot of life left to live and art still to make—good news for the rest of us.Meacham, a Pulitzer Prize–winning biographer, is an executive editor at Random House and a TIME contributing editor at large",http://time.com/3822067/tim-mcgraw-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/tim-mcgraw-time-100-2015-artists.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Kevin Hart,"Luther Vandross once said that anybody can make people scream, but you’ve got to be great to make people be quiet. For a long time, the only person who could make me scream and then make me be quiet was my grandmother holding a belt.But three years ago, I saw Kevin Hart at his sold-out show at Madison Square Garden—not an announced sold-out, a real sold-out, with bikes in the aisles and people on the handlebars. And Kevin did what only a really great comedian can do. He made Madison Square Garden feel like a small comedy club. When he wanted them to, he had the audience screaming. And when he wanted them to pay attention, they were quieter than a football player at a murder trial.Right now, Kev is the biggest stand-up comedian in the country. I don’t even think there’s a No. 2, to be honest. I wrote, directed and starred in Top Five with Kevin Hart. And I made sure Kevin was in every ad. I put emails from Kevin in my movie. I shouldn’t have even called it Top Five; I should’ve called it Kevin Hart Presents Chris Rock’s “Top Five With Kevin Hart.” Hillary should announce Kevin as her running mate and be done with it.After he makes you laugh for an hour, you feel like you’re his friend—you feel his joy and his pain. If he has asthma, you have asthma. That’s because Kevin’s vulnerable. When he’s talking about his kids, his kids know more than him. He’s not afraid to be “father knows less.” That makes him a new kind of cool. Not a keep-a-distance-from-the-audience kind of cool, but a lovable, show-your-warts kind of cool.In Kevin’s comedy, there’s the minute observations of Jerry Seinfeld, the family-oriented storytelling of Bill Cosby and the open-wound honesty of Richard Pryor. But mostly there’s a lot of Kevin Hart.I recently told Jerry, “Kevin’s at the big-boy table now, and nobody’s telling him to go away.” But we all agree he should pick up the check.Rock is a comedian, actor and director",http://time.com/3823293/kevin-hart-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/kevin-hart-time-100-2015-artists.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,"It’s the rare novelist who in the space of a year finds her words sampled by Beyoncé, optioned by Lupita Nyong’o and honored with the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. But the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is just that sort of novelist. A MacArthur “genius” grant recipient, Adichie writes of the complex aftermath of Nigeria’s colonial history and her nation’s rise to prominence in an era when immigration to the West no longer means a one-way ticket. With her viral TEDxEuston talk, “We Should All Be Feminists,” she found her voice as cultural critic. (You can hear it rising midway through Beyoncé’s woman-power anthem “Flawless.”) She sets her love stories amid civil war (Half of a Yellow Sun) and against a backdrop of racism and migration (Americanah). But her greatest power is as a creator of characters who struggle profoundly to understand their place in the world.Jones is a deputy managing editor of TIME",http://time.com/3823296/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-time-100-2015-artists.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Julianne Moore,"Fearless. That is the first word that comes to mind when I think of Julianne Moore. Of course, the words beautiful, elegant, smart, loyal and steadfast can be used to describe her too.I was fortunate enough to witness Julianne’s incredible skill as an actress firsthand when we worked together on a film that I directed called A Single Man. I remember looking through the camera lens before the first take and realizing that she projects something very rare: an actual luminosity that is dazzling in life and that can be captured on film. This is the difference between an actor and a star.Julianne’s character off set is just as magnetic as her onscreen presence. She has an inner beauty that will never fade. She is down to earth and real. For my 50th birthday we went white-water rafting in Idaho, where we had no baths or toilets for five days. She seemed just as comfortable in the wilderness, stripped of the trappings of stardom, as she is in front of the camera.Julianne is one of the greatest actresses working today, but she’s also a wonderful human being. I am honored to call her my friend.Ford is a fashion designer and director",http://time.com/3822884/julianne-moore-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/julianne-moore-time-100-2015-artists.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Christopher Nolan,"From Batman Begins to Interstellar, I did six blockbusters in a row with Christopher Nolan. I don’t think I’ve done two blockbusters in a row with anyone else. I used to call him the new David Lean, but he’s not. He’s the Christopher Nolan.Aside from being a brilliant director, he’s a brilliant screenwriter with an element of surprise and an intelligence that’s quite extraordinary. Just when you think that’s where we’re going, he says, “Let’s go over there!”Christopher is very secretive, and each film has a code title. He had us call Inception by the name Oliver’s Arrow. On the set, no matter how hot it is, he wears an overcoat and sips tea all day. You wouldn’t be able to pick him out as the director. There’s no shouting and screaming—he’s a very quiet gentleman. If you get it wrong, you just do it again. It’s like working with a philosopher.Caine, a two-time Academy Award winner, recently starred in Kingsman: The Secret Service",http://time.com/3822892/christopher-nolan-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/christopher-nolan-time-100-2015-artists.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Marie Kondo,"I have been following Marie Kondo’s simple, clear rules for a decluttered life since way before they were written. My mother was an early adopter of order, and I the apple from her very organized tree.But I have learned a few tricks from this modern-day “Marie Poppins,” who has turned decluttering—what I have called brooming for decades—into shelf help, an art form with a legion of newly neat devotees. Her book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, is a literal how-to-heave-ho, and I recommend it for anyone who struggles with the material excess of living in a privileged society. (Thanks to Ms. Kondo, I kiss my old socks goodbye.)What I love most about her method is the respect she suggests we show our soon-to-be-departed possessions. If they don’t “spark joy” in our hearts, as she puts it, then we should pause to acknowledge our memories together and let them spark joy for someone else.To show you how serious my respect for Ms. Kondo is: if I ever get a tattoo, it will say, Spark Joy!Curtis is an acclaimed author and actor",http://time.com/3822899/marie-kondo-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/marie-kondo-time-100-2015-artists.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
John Oliver,"I felt so excited and honored when I learned that John Oliver would feature the Society of Women Engineers as a worthy recipient of scholarship donations on his show. After John mentioned SWE, many more people suddenly became aware of us and our mission to encourage women to become—and stay—engineers.John is powerful because he isn’t afraid to tackle important issues thoughtfully, without fear or apology. But he’s unique because he uses irreverent humor to make people think. The U.S. needs more engineers, especially women, who are so underrepresented in the field, and we’re doing something about it. The show’s mention helped SWE raise more funds than we could have hoped for—money that would otherwise have taken our society many years to raise. This small consideration from John Oliver inspired many to donate and help young, aspiring female engineers pursue their degrees and positively impact our world.Bierman is the president of the Society of Women Engineers",http://time.com/3822865/john-oliver-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/john-oliver-time-100-2015-artists.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Jorge Ramos,"Jorge Ramos is silver-haired and gray-eyed, but inside that ring of steel beats a heart of gold.Ramos wrangles with President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner; he swims the Rio Grande; he says he asks every question as if it’s his last, determined to get an answer or go down trying. What happened to immigration reform? He knows he has a voice and is not afraid to use it. He shouts from every rooftop that Hispanic rights are human rights.After decades on the cutting edge of the news agenda, Jorge Ramos, who grew up in Mexico, is waging the campaign of a lifetime, which is also a defining issue for America, the country he calls home.To Democrats and Republicans he says Hispanics are “truly tired” of what he has dubbed their “Christopher Columbus syndrome.” “They discover us during the presidential campaigns and then they forget about us,” he says.With another presidential election coming up, if anyone can move this needle, Jorge Ramos can—and he must.Amanpour is CNN’s chief international correspondent and host of AmanpourPick up the TIME 100 issue on newsstands, or click here to buy it online.",http://time.com/3823152/jorge-ramos-2015-time-100/,None
Narendra Modi,"As a boy, Narendra Modi helped his father sell tea to support their family. Today, he’s the leader of the world’s largest democracy, and his life story—from poverty to Prime Minister—reflects the dynamism and potential of India’s rise.Determined to help more Indians follow in his path, he’s laid out an ambitious vision to reduce extreme poverty, improve education, empower women and girls and unleash India’s true economic potential while confronting climate change. Like India, he transcends the ancient and the modern—a devotee of yoga who connects with Indian citizens on Twitter and imagines a “digital India.”When he came to Washington, Narendra and I visited the memorial to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. We reflected on the teachings of King and Gandhi and how the diversity of backgrounds and faiths in our countries is a strength we have to protect.

Angela Merkel,"I became President of Ukraine right after Russia annexed Crimea and began supplying its weapons and mercenaries to Donbass. They were later followed by Russian regular troops. We desperately needed a strong reaction from the world to the brutal aggression against the sovereign nation: a tool kit that included immediate decisive steps, a longer-term vision, significant political weight and, most important, courage matched by unswerving commitment to democratic values. This came with the diplomatic effort led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her shaping of the Normandy format of talks between Ukraine and Russia, which saw the participation of Germany and France for the peaceful resolution of a conflict that still risks becoming a full-scale war in the heart of Europe.Throughout this diplomatic effort, during which I have had 60 conversations on the phone with Mrs. Merkel over the past nine months, I have often asked myself: Is it unbending faith, true German persistence, meticulous attention to detail or perhaps a strong combination of all these qualities that drives Angela?The June meeting in Normandy, the October discussion in Milan but most dramatically the 17 hours of overnight talks in Minsk in February were not simply a test of diplomacy, leadership and efficiency but a test of willpower.I vividly remember, when many attempts to agree with Vladimir Putin on a badly needed cease-fire turned out to be in vain, it was Angela Merkel who would go on, calmly saying, “O.K., but why shouldn’t we go back to discussing?” so that no one could doubt she would walk out with a result.Recently in Berlin she described her general approach as working to turn the impossible into the possible.Angela Merkel managed to leverage German economic power into diplomatic power to lead a major security effort on behalf of the world, which, most importantly, entrusted her with that effort. This attainment has been fully recognized not only by her partners but by her harshest political opponents as well.Poroshenko is the President of Ukraine",http://time.com/3823146/angela-merkel-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/angela-merkel-time-100-2015-leaders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Bob Corker,"Curious about tunnels smuggling supplies from Egypt to Gaza, U.S. Senator Bob Corker hailed a jeep, rode to the border, inspected the tunnels and that afternoon showed photographs to a startled Benjamin Netanyahu. In Chattanooga, Corker’s penchant for aggressive fact finding caused this former construction executive and mayor to help 10,000 families find decent homes.Now it has thrust the junior Senator from Tennessee into bipartisan deals on debt, financial regulation, immigration and Iran. In 2014 he voted with the majority of Republican Senators 85% of the time, but he is a conservative who prizes results over speeches. He is unafraid to challenge President Obama and unafraid to work with him.His tough-minded pragmatism and grasp of economics have restored prestige to the Foreign Relations Committee and are reminiscent of George H.W.

And she will be hands-on.Ghani, who has a long history of activism, has already vowed to work to improve living standards for women in a country where they have historically struggled to be treated fairly. She will have her work cut out for her, as a non-Afghan and as a Christian woman in a Muslim nation. But she is highly educated, articulate and quite evidently passionate.

Muhammadu Buhari,"Muhammadu Buhari made history in March by becoming the first candidate to oust a sitting Nigerian President through the ballot box. Now he has to live up to voters’ expectations. From battling the Boko Haram insurgency to tackling endemic corruption, Buhari has many challenges ahead. The greatest may be overcoming his past as a military ruler who seized power in 1983. Already the born-again democrat is demonstrating the inclusivity necessary to lead a nation riven by ethnic and religious tensions. “We must begin to heal the wounds and work toward a better future,” he said in his April 1 victory speech. “We do this first by extending a hand of friendship and conciliation across the political divide.” It’s a promising start for a President-to-be who wants to leave a legacy to match the historic conditions of his election.Baker is TIME’s Africa bureau chief",http://time.com/3823002/muhammadu-buhari-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/mahammadu-buhari-time-100-2015-leaders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Alexis Tsipras,"At his campaign’s closing rally in Athens, Alexis said to me, “We should meet now, but if you don’t mind, let’s do it at my house. I’d like to spend some time with my kids.” That’s who Alexis Tsipras is: a family man who can talk politics while his two little ones hang around his neck. When he was one of the Greek left’s young leaders, he understood that in politics you have to aspire to win and that the most important thing you can do is defend your country. This follower of Panathinaikos, this fan of rock ’n’ roll who used to travel around by motorcycle before being elected Prime Minister, became the hope of Greeks facing the disastrous effects of the austerity policies that had been imposed on their country. Today he is a responsible head of government who has impressed Europe with negotiating skills that combine wisdom and principle. It’s no accident that Greeks rate his government higher than any other in recent years. Alexis Tsipras represents a Europeanism shared by those of us who understand that democracy on our continent has to be linked to sovereignty and social justice.Iglesias is the secretary general of the Spanish leftist party Podemos",http://time.com/3823031/alexis-tsipras-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/alexis-tsipras-time-100-2015-leaders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Vladimir Putin,"“Behave or else,” say leaders of the world’s most powerful countries—and Vladimir Putin continues to choose “else.” He does it in ways that strengthen his hold on a nation increasingly under stress. The Russian President is significant in any year, because no one in the world has amassed greater political authority in a country so important to international politics and the global economy. Putin’s place on this year’s list comes thanks to his gravity-defying ability to confront the West in ways that boost his popularity in a country suffering through an economic meltdown for which his own policies are largely responsible. No leader arouses more fascination around the world, because his actions speak a language of defiance that so many of his people want to hear, lifting him to levels of popularity that other leaders can only envy. How long can he remain aloft? Don’t bet against him quite yet.Bremmer, TIME’s foreign-affairs columnist, is the president of Eurasia Group, a political-risk consultancy",http://time.com/3822627/vladimir-putin-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/vladimir-putin-time-100-2015-leaders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Obiageli Ezekwesili,"Like northern Uganda, where I live, northern Nigeria is very isolated. For many years, the women who were abducted from our region remained invisible. So although I have not met Obiageli Ezekwesili, I know the #BringBackOurGirls campaign that she championed is very important. It would have taken a long time to raise awareness about the girls taken by Boko Haram without her using her platform as a former Minister of Education.We need to remember that these girls are undergoing psychological and maybe physical torture. So I love that the campaign says, “Bring back our girls,” and not “Bring back my child.” Everybody is in unison with the parents and the relatives. Everyone is feeling their pain. Everyone will be ready to embrace the girls and offer them care and compassion if they are rescued or manage to escape.It has been a year, and the girls haven’t been rescued, but she has made a difference by speaking about it. Not just speaking but shouting. I know some people will say she is too loudmouthed. The loud mouth is needed.

And she never hesitates to hold powerful people’s feet to the fire: bankers, lobbyists, senior government officials and, yes, even presidential aspirants.Elizabeth Warren’s journey from janitor’s daughter to Harvard professor to public watchdog to U.S. Senator has been driven by an unflagging determination to level the playing field for hardworking American families like the one she grew up with in Oklahoma.

President Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, rose from humble origins to become a prosperous entrepreneur, the first Indonesian President ever to do so. He has been an accomplished mayor of Solo, his hometown, and of Jakarta, one of the world’s great megacities. I was particularly impressed when he stood up to Muslim extremists who objected to his appointing a Christian woman as a district chief in Jakarta in 2013. That commitment to Indonesia’s tradition of religious diversity makes Widodo’s success vital not only for Indonesia but also for a world that needs the example of a successful Muslim-majority democracy.

Xi has a clear vision: rebuild the Communist Party’s legitimacy and ensure its longevity through his anticorruption campaign, while using that power to drive a Chinese “renaissance” through a second wave of market reforms. Xi has vast experience in the practical business of administration, having already run two major provinces and the city of Shanghai. As the proud son of a revolutionary leader, Politburo member and survivor of the Cultural Revolution, Xi has acquired through his own experience the political skills needed to negotiate internal party politics. Will he succeed? The obstacles are formidable, but so is Xi’s self-confidence and his driving sense of national mission. His success matters for his nation and the world.

John Ellis Bush has been busy this spring working boardrooms for cash and backyard patios for grassroots support while introducing himself to voters across the country. The buttoned-up former governor of Florida hopes to attract a new, more diverse generation of voters to a party that has lost the popular vote in five of the past six presidential elections.In Tallahassee, Bush developed a reputation as one of the most conservative governors in the country, leading the charge on education reform, pro-life legislation and tax cuts. Now he’s looking to follow his father and brother to the White House on a platform of reaffirming the “right to rise” into the middle class. His administration was among the most tech-forward of his era, and the prolifically emailing pol is plotting to embrace new tools to engage voters in a conversation.His course is clear, but his path is hardly unobstructed. And so Bush is hiring staff and raising money as he looks to run a “joyful” campaign in a crowded field. It is his first race in 13 years.

He is unafraid of big ideas, powerful interest groups or impossible challenges, and that’s why he has become the most influential leader in American public health since C. Everett Koop. In New York City, Tom spearheaded our push to ban smoking in bars and restaurants, which has been copied around the world. He led our efforts to ban trans fats and place calorie counts on the menus of chain restaurants, an idea that Congress later brought to the whole country.

Samantha Power,"Samantha Power first appeared in the TIME 100 in 2004, after writing a book that chronicled the most regrettable experience of my diplomatic career as U.S. ambassador to the U.N.—the failure to stop the Rwandan genocide. A brilliant journalist and human-rights advocate, she was rightfully hailed as the “new conscience of the U.S. foreign policy establishment.” But she was still in many ways an outsider, inexperienced in the realities of national-security decisionmaking.More than 10 years later, Power is an insider, but she has retained her moral vision. As America’s U.N. ambassador, she has been a powerful friend to the displaced and downtrodden and a foe of dictators and despots. She has seen how hard it is to compel the world to act, but she has never stopped defending the values America holds dear. I once regarded Samantha Power as a critic.

Raúl Castro,"“You see me as I am now, happy and free,” a long-haired, 27-year-old Raúl Castro told a LIFE journalist in 1958, as the two bumped along mud roads in an open jeep. “But when I meet the United States consul, I will be very serious indeed.” LIFE was in Cuban rebel territory in the wake of Raúl’s bold kidnapping of 47 Americans, whose release he was about to negotiate in exchange for his own set of demands. The negotiations worked, and the event was a public relations coup for the rebel cause: the charmed “hostages” heartily embraced their captors as they were let go.Until he shook hands with President Obama, first at the 2013 funeral of Nelson Mandela, then at the Summit of the Americas in Panama City this April, that 1958 meeting in the mountains of Oriente province was very probably the last time Raúl Castro had spoken with a U.S. official. Rumor has it that Fidel disapproved of Raúl’s kidnapping stunt but could do nothing about it. Now that Fidel has transitioned to something like a Cuban Jimmy Carter, preoccupied with nuclear proliferation and climate change, Raúl has taken groundbreaking steps toward normalizing relations with the U.S. Those changes have prefigured Obama’s late-date but also significant efforts, which we can hope will finally end the insulting, cruel and utterly failed 50-year U.S. embargo against the island.Raúl, I wager, will insist that the U.S. respect Cuba’s right to sustain some form of socialism and protect its main achievements, such as education and universal health care. But the real question is, can Cuba manage to do so, despite the destabilizing influx of foreign capital that will be sure to follow this historic rapprochement.Kushner is the author of Telex From Cuba and The ­Flamethrowers",http://time.com/3823257/raul-castro-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/raul-castro-time-100-2015-leaders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Kim Jong Un,"Three years have passed since the succession of Kim Jong Un. His father was a repressor who let millions die of starvation. Kim’s educational background abroad, including studies in Switzerland, raised hopes that he might open North Korea.Those hopes have gone unfulfilled. Kim Jong Un showed his international influences by mobilizing military forces to build the Masikryung ski resort in North Korea in part to fulfill his wish to live close to the Alps. The “progress” he has brought to the country is reflected by the construction of a massive water park that continues to operate despite power cuts to homes in Pyongyang. Supermarkets, Internet shopping, Italian restaurants, European beers and coffee shops are the luxuries he has made available for a tiny privileged class. The rest of the starving population is left neglected.It turns out there are only small differences between Kim Jong Un and his father. The son does not share his father’s reported fear of airplanes; he has publicized his wife in the media and has made internal party matters—like the execution of his uncle Jang Sung Taek—completely public. Most of Jang’s supporters have been purged, sent to political prison camps or executed.Kim Jong Un might show some degree of modernity, but the system of totalitarian repression and leader worship remains unchanged. However, North Koreans have ceased to chant his name with their sincere hearts, and Kim’s allies are slowly backing away from him.

Abubakar Shekau,"Most Americans do not yet recognize his name, but the citizens of Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, know Abubakar Shekau all too well: he is the most violent killer their country has ever seen. Shekau took over the terrorist organization Boko Haram in 2009 after the group had been weakened by Nigerian government forces.Shekau, who is believed to be in his 30s, began to stage increasingly daring kidnapping and killing raids on schools, churches and mosques thought by Boko Haram to be violating their interpretation of Islam. The taking of over 200 schoolgirls in April 2014 brought Boko Haram into the international spotlight.By most accounts, Boko Haram has killed more than 10,000 people and is spreading into neighboring countries. Shekau’s latest action may finally summon a U.S. response: he has publicly aligned his group with ISIS, the terrorist group that holds territory in Syria and Iraq and has expanded its reach into Yemen and Libya.Ham served as chief of U.S. Africa Command from 2011 to 2013",http://time.com/3823849/abubakar-shekau-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/abubakar-shekau-time-100-2015-leaders-illustration.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Benjamin Netanyahu,"I knew Bibi, decades ago, as a soldier and young officer under my command facing real fire. He was determined, effective and focused. Character does not change. Chickensh-t he is not. But over time, while thoughtful and an avid reader of history, he developed a mind-set at once pessimistic, passive and anxious. Benjamin Netanyahu seems to avoid any initiative. Some say it’s all about surviving in power. I think he is more complex and nuanced.Netanyahu was just elected, for the fourth time, to lead Israel. I personally know it’s not trivial to win office, simple to govern or easy to leave a positive imprint on history. Netanyahu is basically right about Iran and our risky neighborhood. But he can fail to seize opportunities, and on the Palestinian question he grossly ignores the slippery slope awaiting Israel in the form of a one-state solution.To leave his mark Netanyahu must swiftly heal wounds opened by his campaign, mend the working relationship with President Obama, fight hard—mainly behind closed doors—for a tougher policy, and even, if needed, an attack against Iran and boldly engage the region’s moderates against terror, radicalism and Iranian hegemony. Daring actions are needed. Not just words.Barak, a former Prime Minister, was Netanyahu’s Defense Minister from 2009 to 2013",http://time.com/3822851/benjamin-netanyahu-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/benjamin-netanyahu-time-100-2015-leaders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Hillary Clinton,"Hillary Clinton is not familiar. She is revolutionary. Not radical, but revolutionary: the distinction is crucial. She is one of America’s greatest modern creations. Her decades in our public life must not blind us to the fact that she represents new realities and possibilities. Indeed, those same decades have conferred upon her what newness usually lacks: judgment, and even wisdom.Women who advocate for other women are often pigeonholed and pushed to the margins. That hasn’t happened to Hillary, because when she’s standing up for the rights of women and girls, she is speaking not only of gender but also of justice and liberty.As Hillary has always made clear, these values are universal, and fulfilling them is a practical and moral pursuit. She is a realist with a conscience and an idealist who is comfortable with the exercise of power.This helps explain why she has been so effective, even in this golden age of polarization. Hillary knows how to draw opponents out of their fighting corners and forge solutions on common ground. She practices the politics of reconciliation and reason. Which, not coincidentally, is also the politics of progress.It matters, of course, that Hillary is a woman. But what matters more is what kind of woman she is.Powell Jobs is the founder and chair of Emerson Collective",http://time.com/3823194/hillary-clinton-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/hillary-clinton-time-100-2015-leaders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Martin Dempsey,"General Martin Dempsey is truly a Renaissance man: an English major who is as comfortable singing Irish ballads as he is devising counterterrorism strategies or dealing with the mess left by sequestration. Dempsey’s time as Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff has been dominated by trips to the Hill to educate those who refuse to learn prior-war lessons.Since graduating from West Point, he has faced traditional fights against the Soviet Union and nontraditional fights against al-Qaeda, Boko Haram and ISIS. His mastery of the kinetic battlefields of the past and today’s counterterrorism strategies makes him a war-weary President’s most trusted military adviser. His cavalryman’s lineage makes him the first post-Goldwater-Nichols Chairman to embody the true tenets of today’s joint warfare. And his ability to sing 162 Irish ballads from memory would make you wish you’d been coached by his grandmother.Chiarelli retired as U.S. Army vice chief of staff in 2012",http://time.com/3823200/martin-dempsey-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/martin-dempsey-time-100-2015-leaders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Beji Caid Essebsi,"Tunisia, the birthplace of the Arab Spring, is now the only remaining hope for a genuine Arab democracy. It is plagued by economic challenges, deteriorating security and a crumbling Libya on its southeastern border. The election in December of Beji Caid Essebsi, leader of the secular Nidaa Tounes party, was a watershed moment. His victory marked Tunisia’s first free presidential election.But since taking office, Essebsi has had to deal with the deadliest terrorist attack in the country’s history, an assault on the Bardo National Museum in March. Now the government has drafted new counterterrorism legislation that gives more power to the state but that human-rights activists warn could roll back individual liberties. It will be up to Essebsi to ensure Tunisia defeats terrorism without compromising the promises of its revolution.Mohyeldin is a foreign correspondent for NBC News",http://time.com/3823201/beji-caid-essebsi-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/beji-caid-essebsi-time-100-2015-leaders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Adam Silver,"Running the National Basketball Association is like fulfilling that famous curse: “May you live in interesting times.” Since becoming commissioner on Feb. 1, 2014, Adam Silver’s interesting times have included Donald Sterling’s racist rant, Bruce Levenson’s mea culpa, drug-related suspensions of players, salary-cap debates and player-lockout rumors. And he’s handled all these potentially divisive issues with openness, fairness and integrity.Most basketball insiders will probably point to Adam’s negotiation of the NBA’s nine-year, $24 billion TV deal as his greatest accomplishment. I don’t agree. While it’s true that Adam has his eyes on the financial prize, it’s even more important that the NBA proves itself worthy of all the money, not just through offering the highest level of athleticism on the court but also by providing the highest level of professionalism off of it. For Adam, just as important as giving the fans great games is giving them great role models. Achieving that goal would be his greatest legacy.Abdul-Jabbar, a TIME columnist, is a six-time NBA champion",http://time.com/3823281/adam-silver-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/adam-silver-time-100-2015-leaders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Lu Wei,"In a system short on transparency, China’s new cyberspace administration boss, Lu Wei, is uncharacteristically outspoken. As China aspires to become a global cyberpower, Lu could hold the keys to its future, determining whether there will be sufficient oxygen for the 21st century. Almost half of China’s 1.4 billion population is online. The U.S. is banking on penetrating the Chinese online market, but the post-Snowden world has meant restricted access. Lu is imposing tougher Internet regulations because of social-stability concerns, which means a new generation of Chinese tech entrepreneurs may find themselves in a culture clash.

Marine Le Pen,"Just under a year ago, France’s Marine Le Pen told TIME her far-right National Front Party would be in power within a decade. That’s a nightmarish prospect for millions who regard her France-for-the-French message as mere jingoism—and it seemed like a stretch.Her prediction, however, no longer seems preposterous. Le Pen has spun gold from voter exasperation, mixing charm and ambition to rack up wins in European Parliament and local elections with an anti-Europe, anti-immigration campaign. That’s made her Europe’s leading right-winger, giving like-minded politicians across the continent a dose of electability. And this month she finally split from her father, National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, over his noxious anti-Semitism.Le Pen has strong allure for many French, who have hit the wall with asphyxiating political elitism and near zero growth. To stop her race for the Élysée Palace in its tracks, France’s lackluster leaders will need to overhaul their ineffectual, gutless style and mount a more appealing revolution of their own.Walt writes for TIME from Paris",http://time.com/3823288/marine-le-pen-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/marine-le-pen-time-100-2015-leaders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Barack Obama,"The morning of Nov. 5, 2014, was undoubtedly the gloomiest of Barack Obama’s presidency. His party had just been clobbered in the congressional elections—and it was widely perceived as a personal repudiation. Democratic candidates had run away from the President and his policies. He was seen as toxic on the trail and a spent force in Washington. The term lame duck didn’t begin to cover it: he was an oil-slick duck, paralyzed and defeated by a complicated world and an unrelenting opposition.Except he wasn’t. The raw facts of the matter said he wasn’t defeated. The economy was growing nicely; hundreds of thousands of jobs were being created each month. Obamacare was a success, despite the robotic Chicken Little predictions of his opponents. And he refused to act as if he had been defeated: he made some of the most serious history of his presidency, producing a framework for a nuclear nonproliferation deal with Iran and starting the path to normalizing relations with Cuba. A difficult world still loomed, and his presidency was far from perfect. But Barack Obama has proved that even after a lacerating defeat, the President of the United States is always, potentially, the most influential person in the world.Klein is TIME’s political columnist",http://time.com/3823210/barack-obama-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/barack-obama-time-100-2015-leaders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Mitch McConnell,"Mitch McConnell’s mind is a marvelous machine. He sees the whole field, instantly assessing opportunities and perils.He is famous for his dignified reserve on Capitol Hill, but my friend is happiest tailgating at a University of Louisville football game with Elaine, his wife of 22 years, and friends from his own college days.He is often praised for his mastery of Senate rules, his crafty procedural maneuvers and his knowledge of the Senators in his caucus.But to focus solely on those things is to miss the larger point: that knowledge, and the whole calculating power of Mitch’s mind, is in service of a higher goal.He loves America and our Constitution. He shares Ronald Reagan’s vision of our country as a special place, blessed by God—a “shining city on a hill”—and he works every single day, step by step, to get us closer to realizing that vision.Boehner is the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives",http://time.com/3822824/mitch-mcconnell-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/mitch-mcconnell-time-100-2015-leaders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Mohammad Javad Zarif,"Mohammad Javad Zarif is the happy face of Iran’s stern revolution. I’ve known him three decades, as he helped end the Iran-Iraq War, free American hostages in Lebanon and broker a new Afghan government after the Taliban’s defeat. Now, as Foreign Minister, he’s the pivot in nuclear diplomacy. For 18 months, the world’s six major powers have courted him as they have no other foreign official. The goal is to formalize the blueprint of a nuclear deal by June 30. Educated at two American universities, Zarif is well qualified to reconcile the revolutionaries and the world. As Iran’s ambassador to the U.N., he engaged many in Congress. In March, an Iranian poll picked Zarif as man of the year. When he returned from the talks, he was mobbed. After a deal, Zarif would be the natural go-to guy for broader détente with the world too.Wright is a joint fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson Center",http://time.com/3822829/mohammad-javad-zarif-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/mohammad-javad-zarif-time-100-2015-leaders.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Joanne Liu,"As president of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Dr. Joanne Liu and her organization have been on the front lines of the world’s first Ebola epidemic.Liu repeatedly got it right, and MSF was at the right places at the right times. In this case, that meant where help was most needed. MSF was right when it sounded the alarm about the unprecedented spread of Ebola. And it was right in sounding the alarm for increased global action. Under incredibly difficult circumstances, Liu was focused and flexible. Most important, she charged—and continues to charge—the world to better respond to crises.For me and for CDC’s more than 800 experts who have worked in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea over the past year, it has been a privilege to work alongside Liu and her colleagues.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg has had two distinguished legal careers, either one of which would alone entitle her to be one of TIME’s 100. When she was a law professor at Rutgers and later Columbia, she became the leading (and very successful) litigator on behalf of women’s rights—the Thurgood Marshall of that cause, so to speak. President Carter appointed her to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1980, and President Clinton to a seat on the Supreme Court in 1993.Having had the good fortune to serve beside her on both courts, I can attest that her opinions are always thoroughly considered, always carefully crafted and almost always correct (which is to say we sometimes disagree). That much is apparent for all to see.What only her colleagues know is that her suggestions improve the opinions the rest of us write, and that she is a source of collegiality and good judgment in all our work.Justice Scalia is the longest-serving member currently on the Supreme CourtPick up the TIME 100 issue on newsstands, or click here to buy it online.",http://time.com/3823889/ruth-bader-ginsburg-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/ruth-bader-ginsburg-time-100-2015-icons.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814

All of it combines to rock me back on my heels every time I see her. Both literally and figuratively, she’s a woman who writes her own songs. That makes for music that’s personal, of the moment and impossible to resist.I’m amazed at how much earned wisdom Taylor threads into her work. She seems tuned in to the greater good, and she embraces—thoughtfully and authentically—the chance to contribute to the world. I’m always trying to find the best words to talk to my kids (and myself) about growing up, but you can’t top her beautifully articulated advice. The haters are gonna hate, but, well, shake it off. She illuminates our inner music that lets us dance to our own beat.Along with her staggering list of accomplishments, perhaps the most exciting thing about Taylor is that she’s just getting started with what she plans to mine from her fierce, curious, boundlessly talented and beautiful heart.Also, it doesn’t hurt that she named her cat after me.Hargitay, an actor and activist, stars as Olivia Benson on Law & Order: SVU",http://time.com/3823888/taylor-swift-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/taylor-swift-time-100-2015-icons.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100
Diane von Furstenberg,"Fashion is seen as a tool for fantasy, but Diane von Furstenberg used it to show us that we can transform our reality.Diane’s life is certainly fantastic—the stuff of fairy tales, magazine covers and Warhol portraits. But let’s not forget: she made her own destiny. She is, and has proudly been, a working woman and mother. That must be why her signature wrap dress is made for modern life. It’s built for speed, sophistication and simplicity. And it doesn’t deny a woman’s femininity—it celebrates it. Just like the designer herself.As an entrepreneur and philanthropist, Diane understands that changing the way women see themselves can also change the world.

From 2001 to 2011, the total number of surfers jumped 35%, to some 35 million, and the sport is projected to become a $13.2 billion global industry by 2017.That rise mirrors Brazil’s own.

Everybody else was fearing nature, but Björk was worshipping it because she needs nature to breathe, like an Icelandic high priestess.As an artist, she’s always on the edge of everything, but it’s not trendy because even when she is working with the latest technology, fashion, images or sounds, she is always offering her own, deeply personal world. If you are really true to yourself and really follow your intuition in the most rigorous way, there is a moment that becomes universal, that reaches everybody.

Jerry Brown,"Last summer many around the world were shocked as we watched the Ebola crisis unfold. We were devastated by what we saw and keen to help. One man, Dr. Jerry Brown, watched too and did just that. He took action and stopped people from dying of Ebola. Through his work as medical director of the Eternal Love Winning Africa Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, and in the face of skepticism and misunderstanding, he trained, taught and treated waves of people who came to his hospital.I am in awe of the health workers who worked so hard to prevent the spread of this disease, but I am especially in awe of Dr. Brown. His courage and determination to fight this disease undoubtedly kept alive many health workers and helped communities fight this deadly virus. It is perhaps too soon to say we have defeated Ebola, but we have certainly started to turn the tide.West Africa and Sierra Leone have a special place in my heart because my father was born there. Like me, I’m sure he would have been proud of the work that people like Dr. Brown did to fight Ebola.

Abby Wambach,"Abby Wambach has always been fearless. Even as a rookie on the U.S. women’s national team, she would score goals that made me say, “Gosh, if she doesn’t win the ball, she’s probably going to get crushed.” She never blinked. If it is what her team needed, it is what she was going to do. How can you not cheer for that?As Abby has developed into a star, scoring more international goals than any other player in history, she has embraced being a leader. There are times when Abby just throws the team on her back and wills it to victory when that looks almost impossible. Abby is also a great role model for young fans and recently led the charge to get FIFA to use grass for this summer’s Women’s World Cup, as it does for men. Though she lost the battle, the fight sent a powerful message about equality in sports. Whether inspiring her team on the field or taking on important issues off it, Abby uses her passion and fearlessness to lead by example.Team USA is poised to do amazing things at the World Cup.

Ina Garten,"It was five years ago that I first heard of Ina Garten from my friend Lily Aldridge, a jet-setting model and new wife, who told me she’d found the perfect fish recipe that she could make in only 15 minutes in a Barefoot Contessa cookbook. The next day, I went out and bought one. I learned Ina had been a young wife who taught herself to cook after her new husband Jeffrey returned from fighting in the Vietnam War. She later studied business at George Washington University and worked in the White House on nuclear-energy policy. In 1978 she opened a specialty food store in the Hamptons, which she ran for nearly two decades before making the jump to television and cookbooks.

Thomas Piketty,"Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century, first published in 2013 and translated into English last year, forced an international focus on income and wealth inequality. President Obama suggested that the issue should become the new national challenge—JFK’s race to the moon.The boldest enthusiasts believed that Marxism, shorn of the gulag and the body count, might get a second hearing.Conservatives noted that Capital was published 50 years after LBJ’s Great Society speech, which launched a thousand government programs to end poverty. Fifty years and $20 trillion in government spending later, the U.S. poverty rate remains stuck at 15%.Was Piketty, a professor at the Paris School of Economics, moving the goalposts from reducing poverty to reducing inequality in order to sidestep that expensive failure? Worse, inequality can be reduced without helping a single poor family—by reducing total national wealth. It happens every recession.And yet, despite those criticisms, every prominent Republican has taken up the challenge, refocusing arguments for economic growth on how it would create opportunity for the “least among us.” Kemp-Roth as social justice.Perhaps Piketty has brought not Marx but John Rawls back to center stage.Norquist is the president of Americans for Tax Reform",http://time.com/3823302/thomas-piketty-2015-time-100/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2000/04/thomas-piketty-time-100-2015-icons.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=814
Malala Yousafzai,"I’m 16 years old and from Dara’a in Syria. I fled to Jordan with my family two years ago.Spending time with Malala Yousafzai made me stronger. I didn’t know her before meeting her in Za’atari camp last year, but I understand she suffered, and yet she continues to fight for what she believes in—for the rights of children and for their education. She is an inspiration for me.When it comes to continuing our education as refugees, I am on the front lines with my friends, speaking to other girls throughout the camp on the importance of going to school. My mother and father are always encouraging me. I saw this in Malala too, and her close relationship with her mother and father.I’ve always loved learning and education, but since I fled with my family, these views have grown stronger. I have seen too much wrong to not use my voice. Malala has shown that education is crucial for laying a foundation for girls and boys to have secure lives.I know no matter what I go through today, it will make me a stronger person for tomorrow. Rather than giving up, my friends and I will continue to think positively and try to make our community better. Girls need to learn to take care of themselves, because if they don’t, nobody will. Our lives are completely different now—we’ve gone from living in homes to surviving in tents in refugee camps. Education is the only way to regain our spirit and control over our lives.I was so honored to be in Oslo to watch Malala be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Pope Francis,"During his term as Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Pope Francis eschewed the extravagant trappings of his office, living in a simple apartment and cooking his own meals. Then he packed his pastoral humility in his suitcase and took it with him to Rome.There, he has instilled a new sense of human-centeredness in the papacy. He has described himself as a sinner, and his nonjudgmental views on contentious church issues such as sexual orientation and divorce have brought hope to millions of Roman Catholics around the world.Though I understood he was motivated by his concern for members of his flock in China, I was saddened in December when His Holiness the Pope buckled to political pressure and declined the opportunity to meet His Holiness the Dalai Lama. They have so much in common.Even so, I love and admire His Holiness the Pope just as much as I admire and love His Holiness the Dalai Lama.
